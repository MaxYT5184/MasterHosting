6. Select location: **us-central** (or closest to you)
7. Click **Enable**

### Step 2: Set Firestore Security Rules

1. In Firestore Database, click **Rules** tab
2. Replace the rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection - readable by authenticated users, writable by admins
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.token.email == 'a.tormen2012@gmail.com' || 
         request.auth.token.email == 'gogojohnny745@gmail.com');
    }
    
    // All other collections - admin only
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.token.email == 'a.tormen2012@gmail.com' || 
         request.auth.token.email == 'gogojohnny745@gmail.com');
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **Publish**

## 🔐 Security

const ADMIN_EMAILS = [
  'a.tormen2012@gmail.com',
  'gogojohnny745@gmail.com'
];
```

### Firestore Rules

- All other collections: Admin only

### Access Control
- Non-authenticated users → Redirected to login
- Authenticated non-admins → "Access Denied"
- Admins → Full dashboard access

## 📝 Database Structure

### `users` Collection
```javascript
{
  userId: {
    email: "user@example.com",
    createdAt: "2025-10-13T17:30:00.000Z",
    createdBy: "admin" | "signup",
    role: "user" | "admin",
    lastSignIn: "2025-10-13T17:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" in Firestore
- Make sure you published the security rules
- Check that your email is in the admin list
- Verify Firestore is enabled

### Admin dashboard shows "Access Denied"
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that your email matches one of the admin emails
- Clear cache and try again

### Users not showing in dashboard
- Make sure Firestore is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify security rules are correct
