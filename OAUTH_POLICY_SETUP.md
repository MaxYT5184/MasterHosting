# 🔐 Google OAuth Policy Pages Setup

## ✅ What I've Created

I've added the required legal pages for Google OAuth compliance:

1. **Terms of Service** - `/terms`
2. **Privacy Policy** - `/privacy`

Both pages are now live on your website!

## 🧪 Test the Pages

After Render deploys (2-3 minutes), visit:

- **Terms:** https://masterhosting.onrender.com/terms
- **Privacy:** https://masterhosting.onrender.com/privacy

Both should load with professional legal content!

## 🎯 Why This is Required

Google OAuth requires:
1. ✅ Privacy Policy URL
2. ✅ Terms of Service URL
3. ✅ These must be publicly accessible
4. ✅ Must explain how you use Google user data

Without these, Google won't allow users to sign in!

## ✅ After You Update OAuth Consent Screen

1. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Try logging in again
3. Should work now! ✨

---

## 📍 Footer Links Added

I've also added links to these pages in your footer:
- Footer navigation menu
- Footer bottom (Terms | Privacy)

Users can easily find and read your policies!

## 🔄 Next Steps

2. ✅ Update Google OAuth consent screen with policy URLs
3. ✅ Save changes
4. ✅ Wait 5-10 minutes
5. ✅ Try Google login again
