# 🎨 Add Your Logo as Favicon

## ✅ What I Did:

I updated the HTML to use your logo as the favicon (tab icon). Now you just need to save your logo file!

---

## 📁 Save Your Logo:

### **Step 1: Save the Logo Image**

1. Save your logo image (the blue "M" gradient logo)
2. Name it: **`logo.png`**
3. Save it to: **`/home/max/Desktop/Max-Crafter-YT/public/images/logo.png`**

### **Step 2: That's It!**

The HTML is already configured to use `/images/logo.png` as the favicon.

## 🖼️ File Location:

```
Max-Crafter-YT/
└── public/
    └── images/
        └── logo.png  ← Save your logo here
```

## 🎯 What Will Happen:

Once you save the logo and push to GitHub:
- ✅ Your logo will appear in browser tabs
- ✅ Your logo will appear in bookmarks
- ✅ Your logo will appear on mobile home screens
- ✅ Professional branding! 🎨

## 📝 Quick Commands:

If you have the logo file saved somewhere, you can copy it:

```bash
# If logo is in Downloads folder:
cp ~/Downloads/logo.png /home/max/Desktop/Max-Crafter-YT/public/images/logo.png

# Then commit and push:
cd /home/max/Desktop/Max-Crafter-YT
git add public/images/logo.png views/layout.ejs
git commit -m "Add MasterHosting logo as favicon"
git push origin main
```

## 🎨 Logo Specifications:

**Current logo is perfect!** But for reference:
- **Format:** PNG (with transparency)
- **Size:** 512x512px or larger (will auto-resize)
- **Your logo:** Blue gradient "M" - looks amazing! 🔥

## 🚀 After You Add It:

1. Save `logo.png` to `public/images/` folder
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Wait for Render to deploy (2-3 minutes)
4. Visit your site and see your logo in the tab! 🎉
